There's no place like `$HOME`
==================================================

This is my home, built on [Zsh], [Git], and [VS Code].

[Git]: http://git-scm.com
[Zsh]: http://www.zsh.org


## Install

Configs are separated into a few groups:

- **Main** dotfiles live in `home/*`. These dot files are linked directly into
  your home directory.

- **Misc** config files live in `misc/*`. These files don't necessarily belong
  in your home directory (e.g. global config files) or on every system (e.g.
  OS-specific).

Each directory contains an install script, e.g. `home/install.zsh`, that will
link or copy their respective config files into the proper locations. These
scripts may also perform additional installation actions.

You can run all of the install scripts using the top-level install script:

```sh
$ ./install_all.zsh
```


## Setup the terminal emulator

Certain features of the Zsh config are only set for login shells. On some
terminals, you must manually flip a switch to launch your shell as a login
shell. This applies to `gnome-terminal`. If your terminal is configured to run
Zsh as a custom command on startup, ensure that it starts Zsh as a login shell
with `zsh -l`.


## Configure the prompt

The prompt looks like this:

```
╭────────────────────────────────────[ master ]──[ csb @ roronoa : ~/dotfiles ]
╰ $
```

The pieces surrounded by brackets are called prompt *widgets*. A widget is just
a function that outputs some text to include in the prompt. To add a new
widget, simply write the widget function and add it to the `widgets` style. The
widgets are evaluated every time the prompt is drawn. No space is allocated for
the widget if it produces no output.

The builtin widgets are:

- `prompt_csb_hostpath_widget` prints your username, hostname, and current
  working directory.

- `prompt_csb_vcs_widget` prints your current VCS branch and additional info
  when relevant. It is hidden when you are outside of a version controlled
  directory.

- `prompt_csb_bg_widget` prints the number of background jobs. It is hidden
  when you have no background jobs.

The prompt is configured with `zstyle` in `.zshrc`. Below is a list of the
available configuration options and their defaults:

```sh
# Prompt widgets
zstyle ':prompt_csb:*' widgets \
    prompt_csb_hostpath_widget \
    prompt_csb_vcs_widget \
    prompt_csb_bg_widget

# Prompt colors
zstyle ':prompt_csb:local:*' main_color 243
zstyle ':prompt_csb:ssh:*' main_color blue
zstyle ':prompt_csb:*' info_color green
zstyle ':prompt_csb:*' alt_color blue
zstyle ':prompt_csb:*' err_color red
```

The `zstyle` command takes three(-ish) arguments: a _context pattern_, a
_style name_, and one or more _values_. The context pattern determines when the
given value applies to the style. The context always starts with `:prompt_csb`
followed by either `:local` when working on your localhost or `:ssh` when
connected to a remote machine. Passing multiple values sets them all as an
array value for the style.

There are four colors that can be configured.

- `main_color` is the primary color of the prompt. The default 243 is a shade
  of dark gray.

- `info_color` is used to draw things like your git branch.

- `alt_color` is used to draw secondary information, e.g. a notification that
  you're dealing with merge conflicts.

- `err_color` overrides the main color if the previous command exited with a
  non-zero status.


## Modular config files

The Zsh config allows configuration options to be spread across multiple files:

- `~/.zsh/.zshenv.d/*`
- `~/.zsh/.zprofile.d/*`
- `~/.zsh/.zshrc.d/*`
- `~/.zsh/.zlogin.d/*`
- `~/.zsh/.zlogout.d/*`

Files in these directories are sourced in lexicographic order (`.zlogout.d/*`
is sourced in *reverse* order).

Typically, these directories are used to hold host-specific configurations, e.g.
host-specific path updates and environment variables. Global configuration
should by stored in the top-level config files.


## Configure the `PATH`

The `PATH` is set in a way similar to the `path_helper(8)` tool on macOS.

The `PATH` is determined by the lines of so-called path files. These lines may
include parameter substitutions and globs. Path files are read in the following
order:

1. `/etc/paths`
2. `/etc/paths.d/*` (in lexicographic order)
3. `~/.zsh/paths/paths`
4. `~/.zsh/paths/paths.d/*` (in lexicographic order)

A similar process applies for other `PATH`-like variables as well, including
`MANPATH`, `FPATH`, and more.

You can add a new directory to the path by creating a new path file:

```sh
$ echo '/some/path/to/foo/bin' > ~/.zsh/paths/paths.d/foo
$ exec zsh -l  # Reload your shell
```

## Configure iTerm2

iTerm2 needs to be told where to find it's configuration. The installation
script will attempt to handle this for you. If it fails, go to the preferences
panel in iTerm2 and set it to load preferences from `~/.iterm2`.
